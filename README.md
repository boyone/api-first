# api-first.com

Welcome to the git repository for `www.api-first.com`!

We want API-first to contain the best information from the community about what you have learned working in your teams.  You can contribute your thoughts, comments, stories, and visions here.  

## Where did the comments go?

Rather than have the communities knowledge burred in comments, we would rather let you contribute directly to the site.  This gives you first-class access to share what you know with the world.

## How can I help?

Right now, there are 2 major parts of the site that need help: the Community page and the Illustrations.  We would love to hear your stories and ideas!  We also need help designing the site and illustrations.  If that is something you can help with, pleas let us know!

To contribute, please fork the site and send us a pull request with your changes.  GitHub has some [excellent free tools to help you](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).  I cannot guarantee that all content will make it into the site, but if enough folks think your contribution adds value, we will be sure to include it.

## How do I build the site?

[api-first.com](http://api-first.com) is a static site hosted by [GitHub pages](http://pages.github.com/).  We use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to build the site and test it locally.  Here's a quick guide:

- insall [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) (comes with OSX)
- [git](http://git-scm.com/) clone this project
- [install](http://gembundler.com/) bundler
- insall the gems this project needs with `bundle install`
- run jekyll `jekyll --auto` which will run this site locally on port 4000.
